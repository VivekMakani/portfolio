								<li align="justify"> Developed an automated data pipeline with Apache Airflow for transferring pathological images, 
									reducing data processing time by 20% and ensuring reliable, on-time data delivery for research studies. </li>
								<li align="justify">Engineered and deployed Computer Vision Models, resulting in a 10% improvement 
									in pathological image analysis and bio-marker Identification, translating into 15% of more study sponsors.</li>
								<li align="justify">Established data quality control procedures, validation protocols, and data auditing 
									frameworks to improve data precision and ensure conformity with industry benchmarks, resulting in dependable
									 research outcomes and reports.</li>
								<li align="justify">Collaborated with lab scientists to automate and standardize slide and file naming, 
									eliminating errors by 17%.</li>

								<li align="justify">Designed, built, validated, and deployed Machine Learning 
									Models and software tools for analyzing and optimizing Anello therapeutics. </li>
								<li align="justify">Provided analytical insights regarding binding sites, tissue, and cell 
									specificity from sequenced data collected by the Discovery team from the patients' protein 
									sequences to enhance the virology team's outcome and develop Anello-backed programmable medicine.</li>
								<li align="justify">Leveraged NLP-based models for genes/protein sequences to predict tropism to create viral
									 vectors that can safely and effectively deliver therapies to target cells and tissues.</li>
								<li align="justify">Implemented positional encoded models to find the tissue-specific motifs and predict 
									the tropism with important binding site positions.</li>
								<li align="justify">Developed Graph Neural Network to find essential features for Anello protein sequence from 
									whole genome sequencing data for improving tropism using TensorFlow and TensorFlow on CUDA using high-performance 
									computing cluster environments. </li>
								<li align="justify">Reported to the head of the Genomics team and worked closely with the drug discovery and platform teams 
									to analyze biological data from various sources and build machine learning-based tools for drug vector design. </li>
								<li align="justify">Built ETL Docker containers and pipeline to load experimental data into fasta format using Airflow DAG to 
									eliminate manual data loading to the server.</li>
								<li align="justify">Engaged with cross-functional project teams and external collaborators to support data-driven biological 
									modeling using Statistics and Data Science. </li>
								<li align="justify">Created interactive front-end for company-wide utilization of developed ML models and functionalities
