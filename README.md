                                <p> <li align="justify">Implemented real-time age and gender detection using OpenCV and Caffe, leveraging a deep learning face detection model shipped with OpenCV.</li>
                                    <li align="justify">Utilized the Caffe framework for age and gender prediction, incorporating pre-trained models with .prototxt files defining architecture and .caffemodel files storing trained weights.</li>
                                    <li align="justify">Developed a Flask web application to provide an interactive interface, allowing users to either stream video from their webcam or upload images for age and gender detection.</li>
									<li align="justify">Employed OpenCV for face detection, creating blobs from input frames, and passing them through the network to obtain accurate face bounding boxes.</li>
                                    <li align="justify">Ensured real-time performance by implementing optimizations like confidence thresholding and efficient blob processing in the age and gender prediction pipeline.</li>
									<li align="justify">Demonstrated versatility by enabling the system to handle both live video streams and static images, enhancing its applicability for various scenarios.</li>
                                    <li align="justify">Integrated practical features, such as face box highlighting and confidence thresholding, to enhance the user experience and improve the accuracy of age and gender predictions.</li>
